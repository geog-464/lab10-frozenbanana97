				1. Check the layers!<br><br>
				2. The styleAll function is declaring all sorts of styling attributes, it contains colours, geometries, opacity, radius (size) and more!<br>
				   The conditional statement is saying that if a feature is a point, then style it with these attributes. The newly styled features (in this case teh markers for Amtrak stations) get returned in the new style as described in the function.<br><br>
				3. The blue are Canadian stations!<br><br>
				4. feature is the actual geojson feature that contains all of the data of each station (they are features).<br>
				   layer is waht is being rendered, its all of the styling of the features.<br><br>
				5. layer.options.fill is a boolean, returning true or false; whereas layer.getLatLng() fetches the numerical values of the latitude and longitude.<br><br>
				6. There is no more fill in any of the circles!!!! And they're HUGE!
